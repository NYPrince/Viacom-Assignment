# Viacom-Assignment
=============================== 

* My Process *

1. I had to Parse information so I found an online json reader to looked through the Arrays and Dictionaries to decide which fields I would like to parse.

2. Went to xCode and put together all the classes need for the project along with the tableviews

3. Imported the MediaPlayer libraries in order to setup the video to be displayed. I could have used cocoaPods to download and configure AFNetworking to handle the parsing of the data but decided to keep things native and use Apples libraries instead.
